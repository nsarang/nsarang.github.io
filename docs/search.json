    "section": "2 Entropy",
    "text": "2 Entropy\nEntropy is a fundamental concept in information theory that quantifies the uncertainty or randomness in a system. Let’s consider a couple of examples:\nImagine you’re trying to guess the next card drawn from a deck. With a well-shuffled deck, each draw is unpredictable – this scenario has high entropy. On the other hand, if the cards were arranged in a known order, each draw would be predictable – this has low entropy.\nNow, let’s think about weather prediction. In a climate where it rains 90% of the days, predicting rain is usually correct but not very informative. This scenario has lower entropy than a climate where rain and sun are equally likely (50% each), making predictions more challenging and uncertain.\n\n2.1 Information Content\nWe quantify the uncertainty or information content of an event \\(x\\) with probability \\(p(x)\\) as:\n\\[I(x) = -\\log_2{p(x)}\\]\nIt measures the surprise or “news value” of observing event \\(x\\). \\(I(x)\\) is also reffered to as the number of bits needed to encode the event, but we’ll get to that later.\nWhy use \\(-\\log p\\)? Let’s visualize it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function captures several intuitive properties:\n\nRare events (low \\(p\\)) have higher information content, as \\(\\displaystyle{\\lim_{p \\to 0^+} (-\\log{p}) = +\\infty}.\\)\nCertain events (\\(p = 1\\)) have zero information content.\nThe negative sign ensures positive information values.\n\n\n\n2.2 Shannon Entropy\nShannon entropy is the expected value (weighted average) of information content across all possible events in a probability distribution:\n\\[H(X) = \\mathbb{E}[-\\log p(X)] = -\\sum_x p(x) \\log{p(x)} \\tag{1}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(p(x) = 0\\), we define \\(0 \\log{0} = 0\\) since \\(\\displaystyle{\\lim_{p \\to 0^+} p\\log{p} = 0}\\) and can be proven using L’Hôpital’s rule.\n\n\n\nTo put this into perspective, English text typically has an entropy of about 1-1.5 bits per character. In comparison, a random string of characters over the same alphabet has an entropy of \\[\\mathbb{E}[-\\log_2{p(X)}] = -\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{26} \\frac{1}{26} \\log_2(\\frac{1}{26}) = \\log_2(26) \\approx 4.7\\] bits per character.\nThis concept has practical applications in various fields. For instance, in cybersecurity, a truly random string of characters (like a strong password) approaches the maximum entropy of \\(\\log_2(n)\\) bits per character, where \\(n\\) is the number of possible characters. The password “password123” has low entropy and is easily guessable, while “Tr0ub4dor&Co” has higher entropy and is more secure. This difference in entropy reflects the varying degrees of unpredictability and, consequently, the strength of these passwords.\n\n\n2.3 A bit of history\nThe terms “coding” and “encoded” in information theory stem from Claude Shannon’s work on efficient information transmission over noisy channels. Entropy \\(H(X)\\) represents the theoretical lower bound on the average number of bits needed to encode symbols from a source, which is why we measure it in bits (using log base 2) - it directly relates to optimal coding length.\nShannon’s Source Coding Theorem formalizes this: no lossless compression can exceed this efficiency on average. This explains why English text (~1.5 bits of entropy per character) compresses far more than random text (~4.7 bits per character), and why compression algorithms excel with natural language but struggle with random data. Understanding entropy as a limit on coding efficiency makes it a powerful tool across various domains like data compression, cryptography, and machine learning."

    "text": "3 Cross Entropy\nImagine you have a source that produces messages according to a true distribution \\(P\\), but you’re using a different distribution \\(Q\\) to encode these messages. Cross-entropy measures the average number of bits you’ll need using this possibly inefficient encoding.\nFor example, consider describing a language you’ve never seen before. You start by guessing how often each letter appears.\n\nThe true frequency (\\(P\\)) of letters in this language is: \\(A: 40\\%, \\; B: 40\\%, \\; C: 20\\%\\)\nYour initial guess (\\(Q\\)) is: \\(A: 60\\%, \\; B: 30\\%, \\; C: 10\\%\\)\n\nNow, let’s use your guess to “encode” messages in this language, i.e., calculate its uncertainty:\n\nFor each ‘A’, we use \\(-\\log_2{0.6} \\approx 0.74\\) bits\nFor each ‘B’, we use \\(-\\log_2{0.3} \\approx 1.74\\) bits\nFor each ‘C’, we use \\(-\\log_2{0.1} \\approx 3.32\\) bits\n\nTo calculate the average number of bits per letter, we use \\(P\\)’s frequencies because that’s how often each letter actually appears, while \\(Q\\) determines the cost for each letter. This combination tells us the real-world performance of our encoding scheme.\n\\[ 0.4 \\times 0.74 + 0.4 \\times 1.74 + 0.2 \\times 3.32 \\approx 1.57 \\text{ bits per letter}\\]\nThe resulting average, \\(H(P,Q) \\approx 1.57\\) bits, represents the typical encoding cost per letter when our guess (\\(Q\\)) is used to encode messages that actually follow the true distribution (\\(P\\)).\nThis approach mirrors how we evaluate predictions in ML: Our model makes guesses (Q), but the world behaves according to the true probabilities (P). Cross-entropy quantifies the average encoding length under this scenario.\nFormal Definition:\nThe cross-entropy between two probability distributions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) over the same underlying set of events measures the average number of bits needed to identify an event drawn from the set, if a coding scheme used for the set is optimized for an estimated probability distribution \\(q\\), rather than the true distribution \\(p\\).\n\\[H(P, Q) = -\\sum\\limits_{x \\in X} p(x)\\log{q(x)} = \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim P}[-\\log{q(x)}] \\tag{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(p(x) &gt; 0\\) and \\(q(x) = 0\\) for some \\(x\\), then \\(p(x)\\log{q(x)}\\) is undefined. To address this we can add a small epsilon to \\(q(x)\\) to avoid \\(\\log{0}\\). In fact, this is a common practice in ML libraries.\n\n\n\nBinary Cross-Entropy:\n\nIn binary classification, we deal with two classes, and the predicted probability for one class inherently determines the probability for the other. If \\(q\\) is the predicted probability of the positive class (class 1), then \\(1-q\\) is the probability of the negative class (class 0). The binary cross-entropy loss combines the log-likelihood terms for both possible classes (positive and negative) into a single expression. For a single data point, it is defined as:\n\\[-\\left[y\\,log(q)\\;+\\;(1−y)\\,log(1−q)\\right]\\]"

    "text": "4 Kullback–Leibler Divergence\nTo measure the expected number of extra bits required to code samples from \\(P\\) using a code optimized for \\(Q\\) rather than the code optimized for \\(P\\), we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

The cross-entropy alone cannot be thought of as a distance, since \\({H(P,P)=:H(P)}\\) isn’t zero. This can be fixed by subtracting \\({H(P)}\\) to make \\({D_{\\text{KL}}(P\\parallel Q)}\\) agree more closely with our notion of distance, as the excess loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nKL divergence is asymmetric, i.e. \\({D_{\\text{KL}}(P\\parallel Q)\\neq D_{\\text{KL}}(Q\\parallel P)}\\) except when \\(P = Q\\).\n\n\n\n\n4.1 Non-Negativity\nIf \\(Q = P\\), then \\(D_{KL}(P \\;\\Vert\\; P) = H(P, P) - H(P) = 0\\). But is zero the lower bound for \\(D_{KL}\\)? Basically the question is whether: \\[H(P, Q) \\stackrel{?}{\\geq} H(P) \\quad \\forall P, Q\\]\nThis is known as Gibbs’ inequality, and it’s a fundamental property of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. It tells us that if you try to use a probability distribution \\(Q\\) to encode data that actually follows a different distribution \\(P\\), you will always need more bits on average, compared to using \\(P\\) itself.\nTo prove \\(D_{KL}(P \\;\\Vert\\; Q) \\stackrel{?}{\\ge} 0\\), we can use the fact that \\(-\\log\\) is a convex function (see Figure 1). By Jensen’s inequality, we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum\\limits_{x} p(x)\\log{\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}} &= \\sum\\limits_{x} p(x)\\times -\\log{\\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}} \\\\[2ex]\n&\\ge -\\log\\left(\\sum_{x} p(x) {\\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}}\\right) && \\text{\\small{(Jensen's inequality)}} \\\\[2ex]\n&= -\\log\\left(\\sum_{x} q(x)\\right) = -\\log {1} && \\text{\\small{(sum of probabilities = 1)}} \\\\[2ex]\n& = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] \\[ \\therefore \\quad D_{KL}(P \\;\\Vert\\; Q) \\ge 0\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJensen’s Inequality\n\n\n\n\n\nJensen’s inequality states that for a convex function \\(f\\) and a random variable \\(X\\):\n\\[f(\\mathbb{E}[X]) \\leq \\mathbb{E}[f(X)]\\]\nSimilarly, for a concave function \\(f\\): \\[f(\\mathbb{E}[X]) \\geq \\mathbb{E}[f(X)]\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Relations to Mutual Information\nLet \\((X,Y)\\) be a pair of random variables with values over the space \\({\\mathcal {X}}\\times {\\mathcal {Y}}\\). If their joint distribution is \\({P_{(X,Y)}}\\) and the marginal distributions are \\({P_{Y}}\\) and \\({P_{Y}}\\), the mutual information is defined as:\n\\[{I(X;Y)=D_{\\mathrm {KL} }(P_{(X,Y)}\\|P_{X}P_{Y})} \\tag{4}\\]\nNotice, as per property of the KL divergence that \\(I(X;Y)\\) is equal to zero precisely when the joint distribution coincides with the product of the marginals, i.e. when \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent (and hence observing \\(Y\\) tells you nothing about \\(X\\)). Intuitively, \\(I(X;Y)\\) is a measure of the price for encoding \\((X,Y)\\) as a pair of independent random variables when in reality they may not be.\nMutual information can also be expressed using conditional entropy:\n\\[{I(X;Y) \\equiv H(X) - H(X \\vert Y)}\\]\n\nCheck out this video for a more detailed explanation: A RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME SUMMATION: Mutual Information and Kullback-Leibler Divergence"

However, it also means that JS divergence is less sensitive to cases where one distribution completely ignores an event that the other considers possible."

These frameworks offer a wide range of built-in loss functions, but sometimes you need to optimize for a specific metric or tackle a unique problem that requires a custom loss.\nIn this blog post, I’ll walk through the process of creating custom loss functions, using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (MSLE) as practical examples. We’ll start by deriving the gradients and Hessians for these functions, to provide the mathematical foundation for our implementations. Then we’ll move on to the code, showing how to integrate these custom losses into LightGBM and CatBoost. Each of these frameworks has its own API for custom losses, so we’ll cover the specifics for each one separately."

It is defined as the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values: \\[\n\\text{MSE}(y, p) \\;=\\; {\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|} \\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{D}|} (y_i - p_i)^2}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(y_i\\) and \\(p_i\\) are the target and predicted values for the \\(i\\)-th sample respectively, and \\(|\\mathcal{D}|\\) is the number of samples in the dataset.\nTo implement MSE as a loss function, we need to derive the gradient and hessian of the loss value with respect to the predicted values.\nThe gradient for sample \\(i\\), ignoring the constant factor of \\(\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\), is: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} \\text{MSE}(y, p) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} (y_i - p_i)^2 \\;=\\; -2(y_i - p_i) \\;=\\; 2 (p_i - y_i) \\;\\propto\\; p_i - y_i\n\\tag{2}\\]\nThe reason we can ignore the constant factors is that it will not affect the optimum solution, and its effect will be absorbed by the learning rate.\nThe hessian for sample \\(i\\) is: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial p_i^2} \\text{MSE}(y, p) \\;\\propto\\; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} p_i - y_i \\;=\\; 1\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPropotionality\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proportionality sign (\\(\\propto\\)) is used to indicate that the expression on the right-hand side is proportional to the expression on the left-hand side, up to a constant factor.

It’s an scale-invariant metric that is commonly used in regression problems where the target values have a wide range of values. I think it’s a good metric for modeling ratios or percentages.\n\\[\n\\text{MSLE}(y, p) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|} \\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{D}|} (\\log_e (1 + y_i) - \\log_e (1 + p_i) )^2\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhere \\(y_i\\) and \\(p_i\\) are the target and predicted values for the \\(i\\)-th sample respectively, and \\(|\\mathcal{D}|\\) is the number of samples in the dataset. The +1 in the logarithm means the target values must be greater than -1, otherwise the logarithm will be undefined. If your target values are in a different range, you can either add a constant to the target values or use a different constant in the logarithm.\nThe gradient for sample \\(i\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} \\text{MSLE}(y, p)\n&= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} \\Big(\\log_e (1 + y_i) - \\log_e (1 + p_i) \\Big)^2 \\\\[3ex]\n&= \\frac{-2}{1 + p_i} \\Big(\\log_e (1 + y_i) - \\log_e (1 + p_i)\\Big) \\\\[3ex]\n&\\propto \\frac{\\log_e (1 + p_i) - \\log_e (1 + y_i)}{1 + p_i} \\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nThe hessian is calculated by taking another derivative of the gradient:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial p_i^2} \\text{MSLE}(y, p)\n     & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} \\frac{\\log_e (1 + p_i) - \\log_e (1 + y_i)}{1 + p_i}  \\\\[3ex]\n     & = \\frac{\\splitfrac{(1 + p_i)\\frac{\\partial \\Big(\\log_e (1 + p_i) - \\log_e (1 + y_i)\\Big)}{\\partial p_i} }{ - \\Big(\\log_e (1 + p_i) - \\log_e (1 + y_i)\\Big) \\frac{\\partial (1 + p_i)}{\\partial p_i}}}{(1 + p_i)^2} \\\\[3ex]\n     & = \\frac{(1 + p_i)\\times \\frac{1}{1 + p_i}  - \\Big(\\log_e (1 + p_i) - \\log_e (1 + y_i)\\Big) \\times 1}{(1 + p_i)^2}   \\\\[3ex]\n     & = \\frac{1 - \\log_e (1 + p_i) + \\log_e (1 + y_i)}{(1 + p_i)^2}   \\\\[3ex]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{6}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there is \\(\\log_e{(1 + p_i)}\\) in the formulae, we need to ensure that \\(1 + p_i &gt; 0\\) for all \\(i\\). This can be achieved by clipping the predicted values to a minimum value greater than \\(-1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                MSLE Objective Function\n\n            \n            \n                1import numpy as np\n2\n3\n4def lgbm_msle_objective(\n5    target: np.ndarray,\n6    prediction: np.ndarray,\n7    weight: np.ndarray = None,\n8):\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                Ensure predictions are at least -1 + 1e-6 to avoid log(0)\n\n            \n            \n                9    prediction = np.maximum(prediction, -1 + 1e-6)\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                Gradient\n\n            \n            \n                10    gradient = (np.log1p(prediction) - np.log1p(target)) / (\n11        prediction + 1\n12    )\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                Hessian\n\n            \n            \n                13    hessian = (\n14        -np.log1p(prediction) + np.log1p(target) + 1\n15    ) / ((prediction + 1) ** 2)\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                Apply sample weights\n\n            \n            \n                16    if weight is not None:\n17        gradient *= weight\n18        hessian *= weight\n19\n20    return gradient, hessian\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                MSLE Metric\n\n            \n            \n                21def lgbm_msle_metric(\n22    target: np.ndarray,\n23    prediction: np.ndarray,\n24    weight: np.ndarray = None,\n25):\n26    preds = np.maximum(prediction, -1 + 1e-6)\n27    squared_log_error = (\n28        np.log1p(preds) - np.log1p(target)\n29    ) ** 2\n30    msle = np.average(squared_log_error, weights=weight)\n31    return \"MSLE\", msle, False\n\n            \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n2.4 Usage\nNow we can use the loss functions in LightGBM by setting the objective parameter in the model, and the evaluation metric by setting the eval_metric parameter in the fit method.\nimport lightgbm as lgb\n\nregressor = lgb.LGBMRegressor(objective=lgbm_msle_objective)\nregressor.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)], eval_metric=lgbm_msle_metric)"

    "text": "3 CatBoost\n\n3.1 Interface\nThe CatBoost interface has a few differences with LightGBM:\n\nThe objective function and the evaluation metric are implemented as as class rather than a function, and must implement a few specific methods.\n\nCatBoost expects the negative gradient and hessian to be returned by the loss function.\n\nIt’s not necessary to use NumPy arrays for doing vectorized operations. Using for loops will suffice, since under the hood CatBoost will convert our function into machine code using Numba.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\n\n\nCatBoost requires the negative gradient and hessian to be returned by the loss function, so we need to apply a negation at the end of the calculations. Intuitively, this is because to minimize the loss function, we need to move in the opposite direction of the gradient, but I personally would’ve prefrred CatBoost hanlded this internally similar to LightGBM and XGBoost.\n\n\n\nThe overall interface is as follows:\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                Objective Function\nCustom loss function for CatBoost.\n\n            \n            \n                1class CatBoostObjectiveFunction:\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                Calculate the derivatives (gradient and hessian) of the loss with respect to the predictions.\nParameters:\n\napproxes (list) : The predicted values from the model\ntargets (list) : The true target values\nweights (list), optional : Sample weights.

    "text": "2 Multi-Layer LSTM\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture specifically designed to handle long-term dependencies in sequential data. It incorporates a memory state, a hidden state, and three gating mechanisms: the input gate, forget gate, and output gate. These gates control the flow of information into, out of, and within the memory and hidden states, allowing the LSTM to selectively remember or forget information at each time step.\nThe memory state in an LSTM acts as a long-term storage unit, allowing the network to retain information over long sequences. The input gate determines how much new information should be stored in the memory state, while the forget gate controls the amount of old information to be discarded. The output gate regulates the flow of information from the memory state and hidden state to the next time step.\n\n\n\nLSTM Architecture [1]\n\n\nThe LSTM cell consists of the following components: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_t &= \\sigma(W_{if}x_t + b_{if} + W_{hf}h_{t-1} + b_{hf}) \\\\\ni_t &= \\sigma(W_{ii}x_t + b_{ii} + W_{hi}h_{t-1} + b_{hi}) \\\\\no_t &= \\sigma(W_{io}x_t + b_{io} + W_{ho}h_{t-1} + b_{ho}) \\\\\n\\tilde{C}_t &= \\tanh(W_{ic}x_t + b_{ic} + W_{hc}h_{t-1} + b_{hc}) \\\\\nC_t &= f_t \\odot C_{t-1} + i_t \\odot \\tilde{C}_t \\\\\nh_t &= o_t \\odot \\tanh(C_t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(f_t\\), \\(i_t\\), and \\(o_t\\) are the forget, input, and output gates, respectively. \\(\\tilde{C}_t\\) is the candidate memory state, \\(C_t\\) is the memory state, and \\(h_t\\) is the hidden state at time step \\(t\\). \\(x_t\\) is the input at time step \\(t\\), \\(h_{t-1}\\) is the hidden state at time step \\(t-1\\), and \\(W\\) and \\(b\\) are the weights and biases of each gate.\nA multi-latyer LSTM is simply stacking multiple LSTM cells on top of each other. The output of the previous LSTM cell is fed as input to the next LSTM cell. The hidden state of the last LSTM cell is the input to the classification layer.\n\n\n\nMulti-layer LSTM Example [2].

    "text": "4 AdamW\nAdamW is a variant of the Adam optimizer that decouples weight penalty from the optimization steps, where the weight penalty is applied directly to the gradients. Adam optimizer uses both the first and second moments of the gradients to adapt the learning rate tailored to each parameter.

We’ll use the Shakespeare dataset, which consists of a collection of Shakespeare’s plays. The model will be trained to predict the next character in the sequence given a sequence of characters.\nAn important distinction to make between the text generation at training time and inference time is that at training time, we feed the ground truth characters to the model to predict the next character; This is called teacher forcing. At inference time, we feed the model’s prediction at time step \\(t\\) as the input at time step \\(t+1\\) to predict the next character.\n\n6.1 Load\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\n\nDownload the Shakespeare dataset which is a single text file from the following link: Shakespeare dataset\n\nwith open(\"shakespeare.txt\") as file:\n    data = file.read()\n\n\nprint(data[:200])\n\nFirst Citizen:\nBefore we proceed any further, hear me speak.\n\nAll:\nSpeak, speak.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nYou are all resolved rather to die than to famish?\n\nAll:\nResolved. resolved.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nFirst, you\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Preprocess\nWe need to convert the text data into numerical data.

I had the joy and fortune of working with a lot of talented people, and learned how to build and deploy machine learning models at scale.\nI completed my master’s degree in Computer Science at Concordia University, where I was a member of the Immersive & Creative Technologies Lab. I worked on applying deep reinforement learning to satellite imagery data for extracting road networks using controllable agents.\nI’m a passionate about solving problems. In my free time, I often participate in Kaggle-like competitions to learn about applying ML techniques to different problems. I try to keep up with the latest research in the field, and am always looking for ways to improve my skills. One of the reason I started this website is to write about things I discover and share cool stuff.\n\nLet’s do something awesome together!\nIf you’re interested in working with me, please drop me a line at contact@nimasarang.com!\n\n\nA little bit more about me…\n\nHere is a timeline of my professional experience and the projects I’ve worked on: \n\n    \n        2022 - Present\n        \n          \n          Expedia Group\n          Machine Learning Scientist\n        \n        Capital Allocation\n            Capital optimization for search ads bidding on Expedia Group's global brands.
