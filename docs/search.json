    "text": "Abstract\nAccording to structure-dependent function of proteins, two main challenging problems called Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) and Inverse Protein Folding (IPF) are investigated. In spite of IPF essential applications, it has not been studied as much as PSP problem. In fact, the ultimate goal of IPF problem or protein design is to create proteins with enhanced properties or even novel functions. One of the major computational challenges in protein design is large protein sequence space, namely searching through all plausible sequences is impossible. In our previous research, we introduced a genetic algorithm called GAPSSIF for designing protein secondary structure. This algorithm benefits from evolutionary information obtained by solved protein structures in PDB. Therefore, we constructed a repository of protein secondary sub-structures to accelerate convergence of the algorithm. The secondary structures of designed sequences by GAPSSIF are comparable with those obtained by Evolver and EvoDesign. In this paper, we modify GAPSSIF so it considers solvent accessibility. Therefore, the simple fitness function of GAPSSIF is improved by a multi-featured one to search through the sequence space more precisely."

My focus will be to capture the overall intuition behind each model and give a concise overview of their architecture. I’ll be skipping over the basics of time series forecasting, otherwise this post would have been far too long. You can find the definition of some of the terminologies I’ll be using in the Appendix.\nPapers that are covered are:\n\n\nDeepAR: An early deep recurrent model for time series forecasting that worked quite well on a variety of datasets.\n\nN-BEATS: A deep residual model that uses basis functions to decompose the target variable.\n\nTFT: Google’s Transformer-based model.\nDLinear: A linear model that blew the transformers out of the water.\nFITS: A univariate linear model that operates on the frequency domain.\nPatchTST: A transformer-based model that uses patches to model the time series data.\nDAM: A univariate model that uses multi-head attention, fourier basis functions, and leverages irregularly spaced data.\n\nLightGBM: This is not a new model, but I have to mention it because it’s still widely used in practice and has a comparable performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions Ahead\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving in, I should note that this review is deliberately opinionated. I’ll be sharing my takes on these models based on my personal experience implementing and working with them, and also I used the opportunity to dust off some old memes from my meme folder.

    "section": "2 DeepAR",
    "text": "2 DeepAR\nAmazon’s DeepAR (Salinas et al., 2020) was one of the early papers designed with having to be trained on large-scale data in mind. The first version of the paper was published in 2017, and this was the era where deep learning was still gaining traction as a solution that could benefit and scale to larger datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe architecture uses a vanilla LSTM with the forget cell’s bias set to 1, encouraging the model to retain information from the previous time steps.\nThe model outputs a probability distribution, from which both uncertainty estimates and point forecasts can be derived. In my opinion, this is the highlight of the paper. The appeal behind probabilistic forecasts is that they can be used in downstream applications, for instance, to minimize risk functions.\nA few ideas regarding the handling of different scales of data are explored.\n\n\nHow to make probabilistic forecasts?\nThe recipe is as follows:\n\nChoose a distribution (e.g. Gaussian, Poisson, etc.) that best fits the target variable.\n\nFor real-valued data, such as stock prices or temperature readings, a Gaussian distribution is used: \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(y-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\).\nFor positive natural numbers, such as counts of ad impressions or number of sales, a Negative Binomial distribution \\(\\text{NB}(\\mu, \\alpha) = \\binom{y+\\alpha-1}{y} \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\mu+\\alpha}\\right)^y \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\mu+\\alpha}\\right)^\\alpha\\) can be used, where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean and \\(\\alpha\\) is the dispersion parameter. 1 Poisson distribution is also an alternative (Chapados, 2014).\nFor classification tasks, a categorical distribution \\(\\text{Cat}(p) = \\prod_{i=1}^K p_i^{y_i}\\) is used, where \\(y\\) is the one-hot encoded target variable.2\n\nTrain the model to output the parameters of the chosen distribution by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data under the distribution, or in other words, minimize the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of the data. For example, for a Gaussian distribution the model would output the mean \\(\\mu_x\\) and variance \\(\\sigma_x^2\\) for input \\(x\\). For a categorical distribution the model would output the probabilities of each class.\n\nSome parameters may be constrained, like the variance of a Gaussian distribution which must be positive. The paper uses a softplus activation function (see Figure 1) to ensure this:\n\\[\\sigma = \\log(1 + e^{\\sigma_{\\text{raw}}})\\]\nIn classification tasks, softmax is used to ensure the probabilities sum to 1.\n\nSample from the predicted distribution to make a point prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the ReLU and Softplus activation functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale handling\nThe main idea behind DeepAR is that instead of independently modeling each time series, e.g. a product’s sales in a specific store, the model can learn from all time series in the dataset, allowing the model to learn from the similarities between the time series. This is done by adding the product-specific features to the input along with the time series data. Categorical features such as these are embedded using an embedding layer.\nOne challenge is that time series may have different scales. For example, sales of a product in one store might be in the range of 0-10, while sales of another product in another store might be in the range of 1000-10000. To handle this:\n\nInstance normalization is used to normalize the time series, both in the context and the horizon, by dividing by the entire series by the mean of the series in the context window.\nSince the input and output are now scale-free, to give more weight to the series with larger scales, a non-uniform sampling regime is used to assign a higher probability to the series with larger scales.\n\n\n\nThoughts\nThe model is simple and straightforward. Having probabilistic forecasts is a nice touch, but it’s more nuanced than what is presented; Learning a distribution rather than a point estimate can sometimes backfire and lead to worse mean fits:\n\nLearning a multi-parameter distribution includes all the drawbacks of multi-task learning, where the rate of convergence and loss scaling can be different for each parameter. Gradnorm (Chen et al., 2018) proposes a gradient magnitude balancing scheme, but introduces an additional hyperparameter. Kendall et al. (2018) adds the loss scaling to the optimization, both for regression and classification tasks.\n\nIn the case of Gaussian distributions, Seitzer et al. (2022) and Immer et al. (2024) discuss the natural parameterization of the distribution and posterior predictive. I especially recommend Immer et al. (2024) for a more in-depth discussion on the topic.\n\nRegarding the scale handling, an alternative approach could be using a sample-weighted loss function instead of non-uniform sampling. On top of that, assigning higher importance to the series with larger scales isn’t something that is applicable to all datasets.\nCode:  Pytorch Forecasting"

    "section": "3 N-BEATS",
    "text": "3 N-BEATS\nN-BEATS (Oreshkin et al., 2019) is a univariate time series forecasting model consisting of a stack of linear layers, with skip connections between them. The model is claimed to be interpretable since the horizon function (considering the target values as a function of time) can be decomposed into a set of basis functions, such as polynomials and sinusoids. N-BEATS has been proven to be competitive in the M3 and M4 forecasting competitions, so the results speak for themselves.\n\nResidual Blocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A basic building block in N-BEATS (Oreshkin et al., 2019).\n\n\n\nBuilding on the success of residual networks, which was first popularized through ResNet (He et al., 2016) and now used almost universally in deep learning, N-BEATS uses a stack of MLP blocks with skip connections. Each block (Figure 2) produces two outputs: a forecast and a residual.\n\nThe forecast output of every block, irrespective of the block’s depth, is summed up to produce the final prediction.\nThe residual output is subtracted from the block’s input and passed on to the next block in the stack as input. In the paper, this is referred to as the “backcast” signal, but I’ll get to that in a bit.\n\n\n\nBasis Functions\nBy the Universal Approximation Theorem, a dense feedforward network can approximate any continuous function on a compact subset of R^n to arbitrary precision. However, this theoretical guarantee doesn’t speak to learnability or efficiency (Felbert, 2023). One approach is to constrain the model to learn the parameters of a basis function, such that would best approximate the target variable. The basis function can be a polynomial (like Taylor expansion), a Fourier series, etc. The intuition is to add an inductive bias to the model which can help in generalizations and interpretability. This is not a novel idea and has been used extensively in the past.\nFor example, to model the target variable \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T}\\) with \\(T\\) being the horizon length, instead of producing \\(T\\) outputs the model can learn the coefficients of a polynomial of degree \\(n\\) that best fits the variable. The inference is then done by evaluating the polynomial at \\(T\\) points:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nf(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x + \\theta_2 x^2 + \\cdots + \\theta_n x^n \\\\\\\\\n\\hat{y} = \\left[f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(T)\\right]\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{y}\\) is the prediction. In practice, we use a normalized time domain between \\([0, 1]\\), so the evaluation becomes: \\[ \\hat{y} = \\left[f(0), f(\\frac{1}{T}), \\ldots, f(\\frac{T-1}{T})\\right] \\]\nFor a fourier basis, the function would be:\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\nf(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_n\\cos(2 \\pi i x) + b_n \\sin(2 \\pi i x)\n\\end{gathered}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(i\\) is the frequency of the sinusoid, and \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_n\\) are the learnable parameters. The number of frequencies \\(n \\leq T/2\\) is a hyperparameter. If you’re new to Fourier series, this post is a good introduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\(T/2\\) upper bound is due to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, which states that the highest frequency that can be represented in a signal is half the sampling rate. This is because the signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling rate is at least twice the highest frequency in the signal.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Stack of Stacks\nWhat if we made the network deeper by stacking multiple stacks of building blocks? Well, that’s exactly what the authors imagined.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same recipe used to connect the blocks within a stack is used to connect the stacks. Each stack produces a forecast and a residual, where the forecast is summed up to produce the final prediction, and the residual, i.e. the residual output of the last block in the stack, is passed on to the next stack as input (Figure 3). Aside from making the network deeper, this also allows to have stacks with different basis functions. Notably, one variation of N-BEATS uses two stacks, the first one learning a polynomial function of a small degree, and the second one learning a fourier decomposition. The idea is that first stack learns the overall trend of the time series, while the second stack learns the seasonality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A stack of stacks in N-BEATS (Oreshkin et al., 2019).\n\n\n\nN-HiTS (Challu et al., 2023) is the follow up to N-BEATS, where hierarchical interpolation is added.\n\n\nThoughts\nThe “backcast” signal, aka the residual, threw me off big time. The paper mentions that the goal of having a backcast branch is to predict the input, forcing the model to retain information. On the other hand, when looking at the official implementation, the backcast output is not used in the loss function at all. At first I thought maybe I was missing something and having a backward forecasting is not the objective, but then I noticed even the Pytorch Forecasting library has implemented a backcast loss based on the paper. This is not universally true and some other libraries like Darts follow the official implementation. My main concern is:\n\nIf “backcast” is not meant to be backward forecasting, then why call it backcast? Why not just call it a residual? This is confusing.\nIf the goal is to predict the input, then it leads to another question. Based on Figure 2, the residual output of each block is subtracted from the input and passed on to the next block. Do we expect the network to learn to output zero-valued residuals so that information is retained post-subtraction?\n\nOn a side note, I was surprised that not any kind of data normalization is used in the model. At least that’s my understanding from the paper and the official implementation.\nCode:  ServiceNow/N-BEATS (Official)\nCode:  Pytorch Forecasting"

The paper is well-written and easy to follow, so kudos to the authors for that. But the more you actually understand the architecture and the ablation studies, the more questioning it gets as to why certain design choices were made, and how they were presented in the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: TFT’s architecture (Lim et al., 2021).\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell, TFT is a composition of:\n\nA sequence-to-sequence LSTM encoder-decoder. This component is actually the core of the model based on the ablation studies, not the transformer (Figure 5).\nA multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism takes the output of both the LSTM encoder and decoder as input.\n\nThere’s a shortcut connection that bypasses the MHA. So the model can choose to ignore MHA if it’s not needed.\nIt uses masked attention to maintain the causality of the time series.\n\nThe input features, are transformed, weighted, and then aggregated. The paper uses the term “Variable Selection” which in essence is a self-attention similar to (Qin et al., 2017). You can also go for a recurrent version like (Choi et al., 2016), but it wasn’t considered in the paper.\nGated residual blocks that resemble ResNet blocks are used in several places as computational blocks. They are present in static feature transformation, variable selection, before and after the MHA, etc. The gated block itself consists of a GLU (Shazeer, 2020), which in Noam’s own words, “we offer no explanation as to why these architectures seem to work; we attribute their success, as all else, to divine benevolence” 🙂\nQuantile regression (Pinball loss) is used to predict the lower and upper quantiles of the target variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Results of ablation analysis in TFT (Lim et al., 2021), where Local processing refers to the LSTM encoder-decoder.

Two linear layers are applied to each component separately, and the outputs are summed up to get the final prediction.

The model first applies a fourier transform to the input time series, then applies a noise removal followed by a linear projection, and finally applies an inverse fourier transform to get the final prediction. Torch has a built-in fft module that can be used for this purpose. The papers shows that FITS outperforms DLinear on multiple benchmarks, but we’ll get to that in a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: FITS Pipeline. The model predicts both the lookback window and the forecast horizon (backcast and forecast) to provide more supervision. The low-pass filter (LPF) is used to remove high-frequency components above a certain threshold, with the threshold being a hyperparameter (Xu et al., 2023).\n\n\n\nThe authors also claimed that they had used Reversible Instance Normalization (RevIN) (Kim et al., 2021) to stabilize the training process.

I notified one of the authors about this, but sadly they’re not acknowledging the mistake.\nIf you’ve been following so far, then you’ll love to know that Toner and Darlow (2024) showed that DLinear and FITS can be reduced to simple linear regression of form \\(y = Wx + b\\), and that the closed-form solution (Silva, 2020) has superior performance most of the time compared to the mentioned models!

It takes the input series, divides it into partially overlapping patches (intervals), applies a light transformation to each patch, feeds them to a transformer backbone, and then passes the output to a prediction head to make forecast. There are two more things worth noting:\n\nIn a multivariate setting, each time series (channel) is treated independently, but they share the same model and are optimized jointly.\nThe authors applied masked pre-training for self-supervision, which is a common practice in language models. During training, random patches are set to zero, and the task would be to predict the missing patches. For this purpose a different prediction head is used, but the transformer backbone and the patch transformation remains the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: PatchTST’s architecture (Nie et al., 2022).\n\n\n\nPatchTST is shown to have superior performance, consistently beating DLinear on multiple benchmarks.\nThinking out loud here, since PatchTST is mostly a ViT applied to time series data, I wonder if the extensions of ViT such as Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021) or T2T-ViT (Yuan et al., 2021) could be applied here as well. Or perhaps someone has already done it and I’m not aware of it :)\nCode:  yuqinie98/PatchTST (Official)"

    "text": "8 DAM\nDeep data-dependent approximate analytical model (DAM) (Darlow et al., 2024) is a univariate model that leverages fourier series decomposition and multi-head attention, and mixes a few ideas from the previous models we’ve reviewed so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: DAM’s architecture (Darlow et al., 2024).\n\n\n\n\nSomewhat similar to N-BEATS and FITS, it operates on the frequency domain and uses fourier basis functions to decompose both the input and the output.\nEquation 2 is used to decompose the input time series using a linear solver. The authors pre-selected 437 frequencies that covers from 1 minute to 10 years, and the solver find the best coefficients that fit the input. The same equation is used as a basis function to generate the output, but the coefficients are learned by the model. Similar to FITS, the model makes predictions on both the lookback window and the forecast horizon (backcast and forecast).\nThe fourier decomposition of the input enables us to have input series sampled at irregular intervals, and DAM leverages this by using a history sampling regime (HSR) (Figure 9) with longer lookback windows. During training, data points are sampled from a long-tailed distribution based on the temporal distance, where recent data points are assigned a higher probability: \\[p(t) = c^{-1} \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{t}{\\sigma}^2}\\] where \\(t\\) is the normalized time relative to the last time step in the context window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the width hyperparameter, and \\(c\\) is a normalization constant which is the sum of all unnormalized probabilities. Note that \\(t &lt; 0\\) would refer to the context window, and \\(t \\geq 0\\) would refer to the forecast horizon.\nBesides the frequency transformation, DAM also embeds the time and value pairs of the input series, and then uses multi-head cross-attention to jointly learn from this and the frequency domain.\nRevIN (Kim et al., 2021) is used to normalize the input series before any processing is done, but instead of using mean and standard deviation, the authors used the median and the inter-quartile range (IQR) to normalize the series, which is more robust to outliers. Conversely, the output series is de-normalized using the aforementioned statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: History Sampling Regime (HSR) in DAM (Darlow et al., 2024). Data points are sampled from both the context window and the forecast horizon, with recent data points (closer to now) having a higher probability.\n\n\n\nThe model is shown to outperform DLinear and PatchTST, but bear in mind that it’s a univariate model.\nYou can find the code in the appendix of the paper."

    "text": "9 LightGBM\nThe uncrowned king, LightGBM (Ke et al., 2017), is the special mention here because even though it’s not brought up as a comparison model in recent research papers, it’s still one of the most used models in the industry and Kaggle-like competitions, and has considerable performance in time-series forecasting, even though it’s mostly well-suited for tabular data.\n\n\n\n\n\nLightGBM and its counterparts (Catboost and Xgboost), are easy to set up and tune, and fast to train. Did I mention that they work very well with categorical data? In the time series forecasting setting, they’re autoregressive models that make one-step predictions. Most of the development time is often spent on feature engineering, feature selection and cross-validation. A few examples of features are:\n\nLag features: The time series values at previous time steps, e.g. \\(x_{t-1}, x_{t-7}, \\ldots\\).\nRolling statistics: Rolling means, standard deviations, mins, and maxes over different windows can capture trends and volatility.\nTime-Based features: Cyclical encoding of time components (hour, day, week, month)\nDifferential features: First and second-order differences, percentage changes, and rates of change help capture dynamics and remove trends."

    "text": "10 Closing Thoughts\nMy takeaways from this review are that DLinear and LightGBM are strong baselines that are easy to set up and have decent performance. PatchTST also has a simple architecture, and could be a good starting point to extend and improve upon, for example by using the extensions of ViT.\nI’m eager to try probabilistic forecasting and see whether probabilistic approaches, when properly implemented with appropriate uncertainty calibration, can lead to better results. I like the idea of decomposing the input and output into fourier series like in DAM, which allows for irregularly-spaced and long lookback and horizon windows.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing I would like to see in future papers is including the persistence forecast as a baseline in the comparison section. Depending on the dataset, it can not only be a strong baseline, but also help us better understand the added value by the more complex models.\nThere wasn’t much time to go over the evaluation metrics, but given that most papers only report the MAE and MSE, it would be nice to see scale-free metrics like MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error) and sMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error) as well."

    "text": "12 Appendix: Glossary of Terms\nAutoregressive: The prefix “auto” means “self” in Greek. So “autoregressive” literally means “self-regressing” - the model regresses (predicts) a variable using previous values of the same variable.”\nIterative Forecasting: Also known as recursive forecasting or one-step-ahead forecasting. Forecasting that makes predictions one time step at a time. The model uses its own predictions as input for multi-step forecasting.\nDirect Forecasting: Also known as direct multi-step forecasting. The model outputs the entire forecast horizon at once.\nContext Window: Also known as lookback window, history window, or observation window. The fixed interval of past time steps used as input to the forecasting model. The data within the window can expressed as \\(X = \\left[x_{t-l+1}, x_{t-l+2}, ..., x_t\\right]\\) where \\(l\\) is the context length and \\(t\\) is the current time step.\nForecast Horizon: Also known as prediction window, target window, forecast window, or decoder output. The future time steps for which predictions are made by the model. Often denoted as \\(Y = \\left[y_{t+1}, y_{t+2}, ..., y_{t+h}\\right]\\) where \\(h\\) is the horizon length.\nBackcast: Also known as backward forecasting or input reconstruction. The model’s attempt to reconstruct the input sequence often used as an intermediate step or auxiliary task for extra supervision.\nPoint Forecast: Also known as deterministic forecast or single-valued prediction. A single value prediction for each time step in the forecast horizon, representing the model’s best estimate.\nStatic Features/Covariates: Also known as time-invariant features, entity embeddings, or global features. Features that remain constant across all time steps for a given time series (e.g., store ID, product category).\nTemporal Features: Also known as time-varying features, dynamic features, or exogenous variables. Features that change over time and may or may not be known in the forecast horizon (e.g., day of week, holidays, promotions).\nPersistence Forecast: Also known as naive forecast. A simple forecasting method that assumes the future value will be the same as the last observed value: \\(\\hat{y}_{t+h} = y_t\\) for any horizon \\(h\\), where \\(\\hat{y}\\) is the forecast and \\(y\\) is the target variable. This baseline gives a lower bound for what we consider an acceptable model performance.\nUnivariate Forecasting: Also known as single-variable forecasting. Forecasting that considers only the past values of the target variable itself.\nMultivariate Forecasting: Also known as multi-variable forecasting or multi-channel forecasting. Forecasting that incorporates multiple related time series or covariates in a single model."

    "title": "Running Llama 3 in the Browser!",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nRecently I came across a few cool projects that allow running LLMs (large language models) in the browser and utilize GPU for fast inference! This is exciting for two main reasons: first, it’s great to run LLMs locally without sending your data to any external server. You can use custom prompts, configure the inference the way you want, and ensure your privacy. Second, you don’t have to deal with setting up Python environments, installing dependencies, and configuring the GPU. The browser takes care of all that! It’s incredibly convenient. With the release of smaller Llama 3.2 models, like the 1B parameter version, it’s now possible to generate quality text directly in your browser, perhaps even matching ChatGPT 3.5 on some tasks.\nThe chat UI below will allow you to download a number of models hosted on HuggingFace, including Llama and Qwen variants. Once you download the model you can disconnect and continue chatting offline. I’ve tried adding a bunch of customizations to play around, but the UI is meant more as a demonstration to showcase the potential of a web UI.\n\n\n2 Chat UI\nYour browser must support WebGPU for a fast inference experience. You can find the list of supported browsers here. I personally tested it on Apple M1-M3 and Nvidia GPUs, and it worked quite well. If WebGPU is not supported, the engine will fall back to WebAssembly, which is slower but still functional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBased on your browser’s information, you have the following backend ☞ \nFor more info, visit https://webgpureport.org/.\nIf you see “WebGPU not supported” in the status above but you’re certain your browser supports it, you can leave a comment below and I’ll try to help you troubleshoot the issue.\n\n\n\nModels that are worth trying:\n\nLlama 3.2: Operates approximately three times faster than comparable models, making it suitable for tasks requiring quick responses.\nDeepSeek R1: Excels in reasoning, mathematics, and coding tasks, comparable to top proprietary models.\nQwen 2.5: Excels in complex tasks, including reasoning and comprehension, with an expanded context window.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Model Settings\n    \n      Model\n      \n      \n      \n      First download may take a little bit. Subsequent loads will read from cache.\n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n      Initialize Model\n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n      System Prompt\n        \n      \n      \n        \n        Configure\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            Configure System Prompt\n            Define the AI assistant's base personality and behavior\n          \n          ×\n        \n        \n          \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n            Reset to Default\n          \n          \n            \n            Save Changes\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n    \n      \n        Temperature\n        \n      \n      \n        \n        0.7\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Max Tokens\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Top P\n        \n      \n      \n        \n        0.9\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Frequency Penalty\n        \n      \n      \n        \n        0\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Presence Penalty\n        \n      \n      \n      \n        \n        0\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      My Chat\n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n3 How It Works\nThe code above runs using WebLLM, a library that enables running LLMs in browser without requiring a server. It’s built on top of the MLC-LLM (Machine Learning Compiler for LLM) framework, which optimizes models for efficient execution on various hardware platforms. MLC-LLM itself is an application of Apache TVM, a machine learning compiler stack that takes in pre-trained models, compiles and generates deployable modules that can be embedded and run everywhere. MLC-LLM specializes in LLM-specific graph transformations and optimized kernels for common operations.\nOne of the major advantages of WebLLM is that it can utilize WebGPU for accelerated inference, which is a web standard provided by most modern browsers that allows developers low-level access to the GPU for general-purpose computing tasks. Make sure your browser is up-to-date.\nTo initialize the engine and download the model, I use the following code:\n\n// Import WebLLM\nimport * as webllm from 'https://esm.run/@mlc-ai/web-llm';\n\n// Initialize the engine\nengine = new webllm.MLCEngine();\n// Download and initialize the model or load from cache if available\nawait engine.reload('Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC', config);\n// List of available models can be found in\nconsole.log(webllm.prebuiltAppConfig.model_list);\n\nWith the engine initialized, I use the following to generate responses:\n\n/**\n * Generate a response using the engine\n * @param {Array} messages - Array of conversation history. Each message is a \n     dictionary with keys `role` and `content`.\n     - `role`: `user` or `assistant` or `system`. The prompt is encoded as the\n        first message with the role `system`.\n     - `content`: the message content\n * @param {Function} onUpdate - Callback function to update the UI with the generated message\n * @param {Function} onFinish - Callback function to handle the final message\n * @param {Function} onError - Callback function to handle errors    \n */\nconst streamingGenerating = async (messages, onUpdate, onFinish, onError) =&gt; {\n    try {\n        let curMessage = \"\";\n        let usage;\n        // The model configuration such as temperature, max_tokens, etc.\n        const config = modelConfig.getConfig();\n        const completion = await engine.chat.completions.create({\n            stream: true,\n            messages,\n            ...config,\n            stream_options: { include_usage: true },\n        });\n        // Stream the completion\n        for await (const chunk of completion) {\n            const curDelta = chunk.choices[0]?.delta.content;\n            if (curDelta) {\n                curMessage += curDelta;\n            }\n            if (chunk.usage) {\n                usage = chunk.usage;\n            }\n            // Update the UI\n            onUpdate(curMessage);\n        }\n        // Get the final message\n        const finalMessage = await engine.getMessage();\n        onFinish(finalMessage, usage);\n    } catch (err) {\n        onError(err);\n    }\n};\n\nYou learn more about the other serve options and how to use them in the documentation.\n\n\n4 Final Thoughts\nAs of writing this I can WebLLM is the fastest library to run chat LLMs over web. For other tasks like speech to text, image generation, etc., you can look into using the combination of Transformers.js and ONNX Runtime Web, or only ONNX Runtime Web alone if you’re looking for a more general-purpose solution.If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to leave a comment below.\n\n\n5 Change Log\n\n2025/01/22: Added prompt configuration settings and updated the UI.\n2024/10/12: Added “How It Works” section.\n2024/10/04: Added Markdown support for the output messages.\n2024/10/02: Added download size estimation for the models from the HF repo.\n2024/10/01: Model configuration settings added to the UI with tooltips.\n2024/09/29: Initial release.\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-SA 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{sarang2024,\n  author = {Sarang, Nima},\n  title = {Running {Llama} 3 in the {Browser!}},\n  date = {2024-10-06},\n  url = {https://www.nimasarang.com/blog/2024-09-29-llama-in-browser/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nSarang, Nima. 2024. “Running Llama 3 in the Browser!”\nOctober 6, 2024. https://www.nimasarang.com/blog/2024-09-29-llama-in-browser/."

    "text": "1 Introduction\nAs a data scientist, I’ve often found myself pushing the boundaries of popular gradient boosting frameworks. Recently I’ve been exploring the implementation of custom loss functions in LightGBM and CatBoost, two powerful tools in learning from tabular data. These frameworks offer a wide range of built-in loss functions, but sometimes you need to optimize for a specific metric or tackle a unique problem that requires a custom loss.\nIn this blog post, I’ll walk through the process of creating custom loss functions, using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (MSLE) as practical examples. We’ll start by deriving the gradients and Hessians for these functions, to provide the mathematical foundation for our implementations. Then we’ll move on to the code, showing how to integrate these custom losses into LightGBM and CatBoost. Each of these frameworks has its own API for custom losses, so we’ll cover the specifics for each one separately."

It’s an scale-invariant metric that is commonly used in regression problems where the target values have a wide range of values. I think it’s a good metric for modeling ratios or percentages.\n\\[\n\\text{MSLE}(y, p) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|} \\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{D}|} (\\log_e (1 + y_i) - \\log_e (1 + p_i) )^2\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhere \\(y_i\\) and \\(p_i\\) are the target and predicted values for the \\(i\\)-th sample respectively, and \\(|\\mathcal{D}|\\) is the number of samples in the dataset. The +1 in the logarithm means the target values must be greater than -1, otherwise the logarithm will be undefined. If your target values are in a different range, you can either add a constant to the target values or use a different constant in the logarithm.\nThe gradient for sample \\(i\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} \\text{MSLE}(y, p)\n&= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} \\Big(\\log_e (1 + y_i) - \\log_e (1 + p_i) \\Big)^2 \\\\[3ex]\n&= \\frac{-2}{1 + p_i} \\Big(\\log_e (1 + y_i) - \\log_e (1 + p_i)\\Big) \\\\[3ex]\n&\\propto \\frac{\\log_e (1 + p_i) - \\log_e (1 + y_i)}{1 + p_i} \\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nThe hessian is calculated by taking another derivative of the gradient:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial p_i^2} \\text{MSLE}(y, p)\n     & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} \\frac{\\log_e (1 + p_i) - \\log_e (1 + y_i)}{1 + p_i}  \\\\[3ex]\n     & = \\frac{\\splitfrac{(1 + p_i)\\frac{\\partial \\Big(\\log_e (1 + p_i) - \\log_e (1 + y_i)\\Big)}{\\partial p_i} }{ - \\Big(\\log_e (1 + p_i) - \\log_e (1 + y_i)\\Big) \\frac{\\partial (1 + p_i)}{\\partial p_i}}}{(1 + p_i)^2} \\\\[3ex]\n     & = \\frac{(1 + p_i)\\times \\frac{1}{1 + p_i}  - \\Big(\\log_e (1 + p_i) - \\log_e (1 + y_i)\\Big) \\times 1}{(1 + p_i)^2}   \\\\[3ex]\n     & = \\frac{1 - \\log_e (1 + p_i) + \\log_e (1 + y_i)}{(1 + p_i)^2}   \\\\[3ex]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{6}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there is \\(\\log_e{(1 + p_i)}\\) in the formulae, we need to ensure that \\(1 + p_i &gt; 0\\) for all \\(i\\).

Using for loops will suffice, since under the hood CatBoost will convert our function into machine code using Numba.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\n\n\nCatBoost requires the negative gradient and hessian to be returned by the loss function, so we need to apply a negation at the end of the calculations. Intuitively, this is because to minimize the loss function, we need to move in the opposite direction of the gradient, but I personally would’ve prefrred CatBoost hanlded this internally similar to LightGBM and XGBoost.\n\n\n\nThe overall interface is as follows:\n\n\n\n        \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                Objective Function\nCustom loss function for CatBoost.\n\n            \n            \n                1class CatBoostObjectiveFunction:\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                Calculate the derivatives (gradient and hessian) of the loss with respect to the predictions.\nParameters:\n\napproxes (list) : The predicted values from the model\ntargets (list) : The true target values\nweights (list), optional : Sample weights.

    "text": "1 Introduction\nWhen I started writing this post, my goal was to refresh my knowledge of LSTMs by implementing one from scratch. I was initially tempted to use PyTorch or Karpathy’s micrograd, but since I also wanted to implement the backpropagation part myself without relying on an autograd engine, I decided to go with NumPy. This choice meant that the optimizer and training loop would also have to be implemented in NumPy, turning the project into a comprehensive deep dive. So here we are 😅\nOn the bright side, it’s been a great learning experience. I’ve refreshed my understanding of computational graphs, gradient accumulation in recurrent models, and the inner workings of the Adam optimizer. In this post, I’ll walk you through the implementation which resembles a PyTorch-like API. The areas covered are:\n\nMulti-layer LSTM Model\n\nAdamW Optimizer\n\nDataset and Dataloader\n\nTraining on the Shakespeare dataset\n\n I’ll be using a similar presentation style to labml.ai since it’s much easier to follow the code when the explanation is right beside it. Be sure to check out their website for some cool implementations if you haven’t already.\nI hope you’ll find this post helpful. 😎\nP.S.

    "text": "2 Multi-Layer LSTM\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture specifically designed to handle long-term dependencies in sequential data. It incorporates a memory state, a hidden state, and three gating mechanisms: the input gate, forget gate, and output gate. These gates control the flow of information into, out of, and within the memory and hidden states, allowing the LSTM to selectively remember or forget information at each time step.\nThe memory state in an LSTM acts as a long-term storage unit, allowing the network to retain information over long sequences. The input gate determines how much new information should be stored in the memory state, while the forget gate controls the amount of old information to be discarded. The output gate regulates the flow of information from the memory state and hidden state to the next time step.\n\n\n\nLSTM Architecture Olah (2015)\n\n\nThe LSTM cell consists of the following components: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_t &= \\sigma(W_{if}x_t + b_{if} \\;+\\; W_{hf}h_{t-1} + b_{hf}) \\\\\ni_t &= \\sigma(W_{ii}x_t + b_{ii} \\;+\\; W_{hi}h_{t-1} + b_{hi}) \\\\\no_t &= \\sigma(W_{io}x_t + b_{io} \\;+\\; W_{ho}h_{t-1} + b_{ho}) \\\\\n\\tilde{C}_t &= \\tanh(W_{ic}x_t + b_{ic} \\;+\\; W_{hc}h_{t-1} + b_{hc}) \\\\\nC_t &= f_t \\odot C_{t-1} + i_t \\odot \\tilde{C}_t \\\\\nh_t &= o_t \\odot \\tanh(C_t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(f_t\\), \\(i_t\\), and \\(o_t\\) are the forget, input, and output gates, respectively. \\(\\tilde{C}_t\\) is the candidate memory state, \\(C_t\\) is the memory state, and \\(h_t\\) is the hidden state at time step \\(t\\). \\(x_t\\) is the input at time step \\(t\\), \\(h_{t-1}\\) is the hidden state at time step \\(t-1\\), and \\(W\\) and \\(b\\) are the weights and biases of each gate.\n\nCIFG LSTM\nIn this post, we’ll implement a special of type of LSTM called Coupled Input and Forget Gate (CIFG) Greff et al. (2017). In CIFG LSTM, the input gate is computed as: \\[i_t = 1 - f_t\\] This reduces the number of parameters in the model and has been shown to perform well in practice.\n\n\nMulti-layers\nA multi-layer LSTM is simply stacking multiple LSTM cells on top of each other.

    "text": "6 Training on Shakespeare dataset\nNow it’s time to put everything together and train the model on the a dataset. We’ll use the Shakespeare dataset, which consists of a collection of Shakespeare’s plays. The model will be trained to predict the next character in the sequence given a sequence of characters.\nAn important distinction to make between the text generation at training time and inference time is that at training time, we feed the ground truth characters to the model to predict the next character; This is called teacher forcing. At inference time, we feed the model’s prediction at time step \\(t\\) as the input at time step \\(t+1\\) to predict the next character.\n\n6.1 Load\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\n\nDownload the Shakespeare dataset which is a single text file from the following link: Shakespeare dataset\n\nwith open(\"shakespeare.txt\") as file:\n    data = file.read()\n\n\nprint(data[:200])\n\nFirst Citizen:\nBefore we proceed any further, hear me speak.\n\nAll:\nSpeak, speak.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nYou are all resolved rather to die than to famish?\n\nAll:\nResolved. resolved.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nFirst, you\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Preprocess\nWe need to convert the text data into numerical data. Using scikit-learn’s LabelEncoder we can map each character to a unique integer.

The remaining part is loss computation and gradient of loss w.r.t the predictions. Since next-token prediction is a classification task, we’ll use the cross-entropy loss function.\n\nfrom tqdm.auto import tqdm\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom op import cross_entropy\n\nstate = None\ntrain_losses = defaultdict(list)\ntest_losses = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor epoch in tqdm(range(NUM_EPOCHS), desc=\"Epoch\"):\n    # training loop\n    for inputs, targets in (pbar := tqdm(trainloader, leave=False)):\n        if SHUFFLE_TRAIN:\n            state = None\n        probabilities, state, activations = model.forward(inputs, state)\n\n        # cross entropy loss\n        loss = cross_entropy(probabilities, targets)\n        # accuracy\n        accuracy = np.mean(np.argmax(probabilities, axis=-1) == targets)\n\n        # loss gradient w.r.t logits (before softmax)\n        gradient = np.copy(probabilities)\n        # Subtract 1 from the probabilities of the true classes\n        # Since the gradient is p_i - y_i\n        gradient[np.arange(targets.shape[0])[:, None], \n                 np.arange(targets.shape[1]), targets] -= 1\n        # Subtract 1 from the probabilities of the true classes\n        gradient /= gradient.shape[0]\n\n        # backpropagate and update\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\n        model.backward(gradient, activations)\n        optimizer.step()\n\n        # log\n        pbar.set_postfix({\"loss\": f\"{loss:.5f}\", \n                          \"accuracy\": f\"{accuracy*100:.2f}\"})\n        train_losses[epoch].append(loss)\n\n    # testing loop\n    loss_sum = 0\n    accuracy_sum = 0\n    for iter, (inputs, targets) in (pbar := tqdm(enumerate(testloader),\n                                                 leave=False)):\n        probabilities, state, _ = model.forward(\n            inputs, state=None, teacher_forcing=False\n        )\n        loss = cross_entropy(probabilities, targets)\n        accuracy = np.mean(np.argmax(probabilities, axis=-1) == targets)\n\n        loss_sum += loss\n        accuracy_sum += accuracy\n        pbar.set_postfix(\n            {\n                \"loss\": f\"{loss_sum / (iter + 1):.5f}\",\n                \"accuracy\": f\"{accuracy_sum / (iter + 1)*100:.2f}\",\n            }\n        )\n        test_losses[epoch].append(loss)\n\nNow that it’s time for training, the bad news is that the process will be slow! Understandably so, since we’re using NumPy over CPU. Still, I trained the model for ~6000 iterations (batches) to make sure the implementation is correct and that the model is learning. The figure below shows the loss curve decreasing consistently over the iterations.\n\n\n\nTraining Loss Curve\n\n\nFor checkpointing, we can save the model to disk:\n\nnp.save(\"checkpoint.npy\", model.state_dict)\n\nTo reload from the checkpoint, use the from_state_dict method:\n\nstate_dict = np.load(\"checkpoint.npy\", allow_pickle=True).item()\nmodel = LSTMClassifier.from_state_dict(state_dict)\n\nstate_dict.keys()\n\ndict_keys(['config', 'weights', 'grad'])\n\n\n\n\n6.5 Generating text\nAt inference time, we feed the model a prefix text and let it generate the next characters. We can control the number of characters to generate by setting the generate_length parameter in forward. I used greedy decoding to generate the text which works by selecting the character with the highest probability at each time step.\n\ndef generate(model, prefix: str, length: int):\n    inputs = np.array(list(prefix))\n    inputs = encoder.transform(inputs)\n    inputs = inputs[np.newaxis]\n    state = None\n\n    probabilities, state, _ = model.forward(\n        inputs, state, teacher_forcing=False, generation_length=length\n    )\n    tokens = np.argmax(probabilities[0, len(prefix) - 1 :], axis=-1)\n\n    output = prefix + \"\".join(encoder.inverse_transform(tokens))\n    return output\n\n\nprint(generate(model, prefix=\"I will\", length=400))\n\nI will rest blood that bear blood at all,\nAnd stay the king to the consulships?\n\nMENENIUS:\nNay, then he will stay the king to the cause of my son's exile is banished.\n\nROMEO:\nAnd stay the common people: there is no need, that I may call thee back.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nHere comes the county strict ready to give me leave to see him as he fall be thine, my lord.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nNorfolk, throw down the coronat\n\n\nLooks like the model was able to learn something! As an alternative to basic sampling, more advanced techniques like beam search, Top-K sampling, and nucleus sampling can significantly enhance the text generation quality but that’d be beyond the scope of this post.\n\nI hope you found this post helpful.

    "section": "2 Entropy",
    "text": "2 Entropy\nEntropy is a fundamental concept in information theory that quantifies the uncertainty or randomness in a system. Let’s consider a couple of examples:\nImagine you’re trying to guess the next card drawn from a deck. With a well-shuffled deck, each draw is unpredictable – this scenario has high entropy. On the other hand, if the cards were arranged in a known order, each draw would be predictable – this has low entropy.\nNow, let’s think about weather prediction. In a climate where it rains 90% of the days, guessing that it will rain tomorrow is usually correct but not very informative. This scenario has lower entropy than a climate where rain and sun are equally likely (50% each), making predictions more challenging and uncertain.\n\n2.1 Information Content\nWe quantify the uncertainty or information content of an event \\(x\\) with probability \\(p(x)\\) as:\n\\[I(x) = -\\log_2{p(x)}\\]\nIt measures the surprise or “news value” of observing event \\(x\\). \\(I(x)\\) is also reffered to as the number of bits needed to encode the event, but we’ll get to that later.\nWhy use \\(-\\log p\\)? Let’s visualize it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Information content as a function of probability\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function captures several intuitive properties:\n\nRare events (low \\(p\\)) have higher information content, as \\(\\displaystyle{\\lim_{p \\to 0^+} (-\\log{p}) = +\\infty}.\\)\nCertain events (\\(p = 1\\)) have zero information content.\nThe negative sign ensures positive values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoltzmann’s Entropy\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that the idea of using natual logarithm in entropy was first introduced by Boltzmann in the context of thermodynamics [1]. I’m interested to read on this later.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Shannon Entropy\nShannon entropy is the expected value (weighted average) of information content across all possible events in a probability distribution:\n\\[H(X) = \\mathbb{E}[-\\log p(X)] = -\\sum_x p(x) \\log{p(x)} \\tag{1}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(p(x) = 0\\), then \\(p(x)\\log{p(x)} = 0\\times\\log{0} \\boldsymbol{= 0}\\). This is because \\(\\displaystyle{\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x\\log{x} = 0}\\) and can be proven using L’Hôpital’s rule [2]:\n\\(\\displaystyle{\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x\\log{x} = 0 = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\log{x}}{1/x} \\;\\xlongequal{\\text{L'Hôpital}}\\; \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{1/x}{-1/x^2} = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} -x = 0}\\)\n\n\n\nTo put this into perspective, English text typically has an entropy of about 1-1.5 bits per character. In comparison, a random string of characters over the same alphabet has an entropy of \\[\\mathbb{E}[-\\log_2{p(X)}] = -\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{26} \\frac{1}{26} \\log_2(\\frac{1}{26}) = \\log_2(26) \\approx 4.7\\] bits per character.\nThis concept has practical applications in various fields. For instance, in cybersecurity, a truly random string of characters (like a strong password) approaches the maximum entropy of \\(\\log_2(n)\\) bits per character, where \\(n\\) is the number of possible characters. The password “password123” has low entropy and is easily guessable, while “Tr0ub4dor&Co” has higher entropy and is more secure. This difference in entropy reflects the varying degrees of unpredictability and, consequently, the strength of these passwords.\n\n\n2.3 A bit of history\nThe terms “coding” and “encoded” in information theory stem from Claude Shannon’s work on efficient information transmission over noisy channels. Entropy \\(H(X)\\) represents the theoretical lower bound on the average number of bits needed to encode symbols from a source, which is why we measure it in bits (using log base 2) - it directly relates to optimal coding length.\nShannon’s Source Coding Theorem formalizes this: no lossless compression can exceed this efficiency on average. This explains why English text (~1.5 bits of entropy per character) compresses far more than random text (~4.7 bits per character), and why compression algorithms excel with natural language but struggle with random data. Understanding entropy as a limit on coding efficiency makes it a powerful tool across various domains like data compression, cryptography, and machine learning."

    "section": "3 Cross Entropy",
    "text": "3 Cross Entropy\nImagine you have a source that produces messages according to a true distribution \\(P\\), but you’re using a different distribution \\(Q\\) to encode these messages. Cross-entropy measures the average number of bits you’ll need using this possibly inefficient encoding.\nFor example, consider describing a language you’ve never seen before. You start by guessing how often each letter appears.\n\nThe true frequency (\\(P\\)) of letters in this language is: \\(A: 40\\%, \\; B: 40\\%, \\; C: 20\\%\\)\nYour initial guess (\\(Q\\)) is: \\(A: 60\\%, \\; B: 30\\%, \\; C: 10\\%\\)\n\nNow, let’s use your guess to “encode” messages in this language, i.e., calculate its uncertainty:\n\nFor each ‘A’, we use \\(-\\log_2{0.6} \\approx 0.74\\) bits\nFor each ‘B’, we use \\(-\\log_2{0.3} \\approx 1.74\\) bits\nFor each ‘C’, we use \\(-\\log_2{0.1} \\approx 3.32\\) bits\n\nTo calculate the average number of bits per letter, we use \\(P\\)’s frequencies because that’s how often each letter actually appears, while \\(Q\\) determines the cost for each letter. This combination tells us the real-world performance of our encoding scheme.\n\\[ \\left(0.4 \\times 0.74\\right) + \\left(0.4 \\times 1.74\\right) + \\left(0.2 \\times 3.32\\right) \\approx 1.57 \\text{ bits per letter}\\]\nThe resulting average, \\(H(P,Q) \\approx 1.57\\) bits, represents the typical encoding cost per letter when our guess (\\(Q\\)) is used to encode messages that actually follow the true distribution (\\(P\\)).\nThis approach mirrors how we evaluate predictions in ML: Our model makes guesses (Q), but the world behaves according to the true probabilities (P). Cross-entropy quantifies the average encoding length under this scenario.\nFormal Definition:\nThe cross-entropy between two probability distributions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) over the same underlying set of events measures the average number of bits needed to identify an event drawn from the set, if a coding scheme used for the set is optimized for an estimated probability distribution \\(q\\), rather than the true distribution \\(p\\).\n\\[H(P, Q) = -\\sum\\limits_{x \\in X} p(x)\\log{q(x)} = \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim P}[-\\log{q(x)}] \\tag{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(p(x) &gt; 0\\) and \\(q(x) = 0\\) for some \\(x\\), then \\(p(x)\\log{q(x)}\\) is undefined becuase of \\(\\log{0}\\). To address this we can add a small epsilon to \\(q(x)\\) to avoid \\(\\log{0}\\). In fact, this is a common practice in ML libraries.\n\n\n\nBinary Cross-Entropy:\n\nIn binary classification, we deal with two classes, and the predicted probability for one class inherently determines the probability for the other. If \\(q\\) is the predicted probability of the positive class (class 1), then \\(1-q\\) is the probability of the negative class (class 0). The binary cross-entropy loss combines the log-likelihood terms for both possible classes (positive and negative) into a single expression. For a single data point, it is defined as:\n\\[-\\left[y\\,log(q)\\;+\\;(1−y)\\,log(1−q)\\right]\\]"

    "text": "4 Kullback–Leibler Divergence\nTo measure the expected number of extra bits required to code samples from \\(P\\) using a code optimized for \\(Q\\) rather than the code optimized for \\(P\\), we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

The cross-entropy alone cannot be thought of as a distance, since \\({H(P,P)=:H(P)}\\) isn’t zero. This can be fixed by subtracting \\({H(P)}\\) to make \\({D_{\\text{KL}}(P\\parallel Q)}\\) agree more closely with our notion of distance, as the excess loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nKL divergence is asymmetric, i.e. \\({D_{\\text{KL}}(P\\parallel Q)\\neq D_{\\text{KL}}(Q\\parallel P)}\\) except when \\(P = Q\\).\n\n\n\n\n4.1 Non-Negativity\nIf \\(Q = P\\), then \\(D_{KL}(P \\;\\Vert\\; P) = H(P, P) - H(P) = 0\\). But is zero the lower bound for \\(D_{KL}\\)? Basically the question is whether: \\[H(P, Q) \\stackrel{?}{\\geq} H(P) \\quad \\forall P, Q\\]\nThis is known as Gibbs’ inequality, and it’s a fundamental property of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. It tells us that if you try to use a probability distribution \\(Q\\) to encode data that actually follows a different distribution \\(P\\), you will always need more bits on average, compared to using \\(P\\) itself.\nTo prove \\(D_{KL}(P \\;\\Vert\\; Q) \\stackrel{?}{\\ge} 0\\), we can use the fact that \\(-\\log\\) is a convex function (see Figure 1). By Jensen’s inequality, we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum\\limits_{x} p(x)\\log{\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}} &= \\sum\\limits_{x} p(x)\\times -\\log{\\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}} \\\\[2ex]\n&\\ge -\\log\\left(\\sum_{x} p(x) {\\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}}\\right) && \\text{\\small{(Jensen's inequality)}} \\\\[2ex]\n&= -\\log\\left(\\sum_{x} q(x)\\right) = -\\log {1} && \\text{\\small{(sum of probabilities = 1)}} \\\\[2ex]\n& = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] \\[ \\therefore \\quad D_{KL}(P \\;\\Vert\\; Q) \\ge 0\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJensen’s Inequality\n\n\n\n\n\nJensen’s inequality states that for a convex function \\(f\\) and a random variable \\(X\\):\n\\[f(\\mathbb{E}[X]) \\leq \\mathbb{E}[f(X)]\\]\nSimilarly, for a concave function \\(f\\): \\[f(\\mathbb{E}[X]) \\geq \\mathbb{E}[f(X)]\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 At Zero Probabilities\nLet’s consider the cases where \\(p(x) = 0\\) or \\(q(x) = 0\\), because it’ll be useful later on:\n\n\\(p(𝑋)=0 \\text{ and } q(𝑋)\\gt 0\\):\nAs a result, \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{p \\to 0} p\\log{p} = 0\\). This makes sense since we sample according to distribution \\(p\\), we’ll never sample event \\(x\\). Hence, it does not weight in \\({D_{KL}(P \\;\\Vert\\; Q)}\\), meaning \\(Q\\) can make mistakes about events that \\(P\\) considers impossible without penalty.\n\\(p(𝑋)\\gt 0 \\text{ and } q(𝑋)= 0\\):\nThen \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{q \\to 0^+} \\log{\\frac{1}{q}} = +\\infty\\). An infinite divergence effectively signals that the model \\(Q\\) fails to account for an event \\(x\\) that is observed under \\(P\\).\n\\(p(𝑋)=0 \\text{ and } q(𝑋)= 0\\): Then it’s really undefined :)\n\n\n\n4.3 Reverse KL vs Forward KL\nThis is something that I had never thought about before, because I had only seen KL divergence in the context of variational inference. But it turns out that there are two ways to use KL divergence in an optimization problem. We had previously established that \\(D_{KL}\\) is asymmetric. This means that minimizing \\(D_{KL}(P \\;\\Vert\\; Q)\\) is not the same as minimizing \\(D_{KL}(Q \\;\\Vert\\; P)\\). The former is known as the Forward KL and the latter is known as the Reverse KL. The practical difference between the two arises when the model cannot perfectly fit the true distribution, which is most often the case. This is where the two divergences diverge (pun intended).\nLet’s say we have a model \\(Q\\) that we want to optimize to approximate the true distribution \\(P\\). It’d be fair assumption that \\(P\\) would be a more complex distribution than \\(Q\\), with more modes and a more complex structure, since \\(Q\\) is a simpler model. As example, \\(P\\) could be a Gaussian mixture model with 10 components (multimodal), while \\(Q\\) is a single Gaussian (unimodal).\n\nForward KL\n\\(D_{KL}(P \\;\\Vert\\; Q)\\) measures the extra bits needed to encode samples from \\(P\\) using a code optimized for \\(Q\\). By minimizing this, we’re trying to make \\(Q\\) as close as possible to \\(P\\):\n\\[ \\begin{aligned}\n\\mathop{\\mathrm{arg\\,min}}\\limits_Q\\; D_{KL}(P \\;\\Vert\\; Q) &= \\mathop{\\mathrm{arg\\,min}}\\limits_Q\\; H(P, Q) - H(P) \\\\[1ex]\n&= \\mathop{\\mathrm{arg\\,min}}\\limits_Q\\; H(P, Q) && \\text{\\small{(since $H(P)$ is constant w.r.t. $Q$)}} \\\\[1ex]\n&= \\mathop{\\mathrm{arg\\,min}}\\limits_Q\\; -\\sum\\limits_{x \\in X} p(x)\\log{q(x)}\n\\end{aligned} \\]\nSo basically minimizing the forward KL is equivalent to minimizing the cross-entropy between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), a common objective in supervised classification problems. As we saw in Section 4.2, this loss ladnscape is interesting around zero probabilities:\n\nIf \\(p(x) = 0\\) then \\(q(x)\\) can be anything, because the loss is zero. The con of this is that it can lead to overconfident predictions in regions with little data.\n\nIf \\(P(x) \\gt 0\\) and \\(Q(x) \\le \\epsilon\\), then the loss becomes significanly large. As a consequence, \\(Q\\) would rather assign a low probability to events that are very unlikely under \\(P\\) than missing them entirely.\n\nIn the interactive plot below you can see how the forward KL divergence changes as you adjust the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution \\(Q\\) (inspired by [3]).\n\n\ndomain = [-5, 5];\nmeanRange = [-3, 3];\nmeanStep = 0.1;\nvarianceRange = [0.5, 3];\nvarianceStep = 0.1;\n\nfont_styles = `\n    svg text {\n        fill: currentColor;\n    }\n    .tick text {\n        font-size: 12px;\n    }\n    .plot-title {\n        font-size: 18px;

This is the mean-seeking behavior of the forward KL divergence.\n\n\nReverse KL\n\\(D_{KL}(Q \\;\\Vert\\; P)\\) measures the extra bits needed to encode samples from \\(Q\\) using a code optimized for \\(P\\). Similar to the Section 4.2 analysis:\n\nIt penalizes distributions \\(Q\\) that assign non-zero probability to regions where \\(P\\) is zero, since we’re minizing \\(q(x)\\log{\\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}}\\). Conversely, it doesn’t penalize \\(Q\\) for missing regions where \\(P\\) has non-zero probability.\nIt tends to capturing the dominant mode of \\(P\\) and ignoring the rest. This can be demonstrated by the following example.\n\nThe plot below is same as the previous one, but this time the contour plot shows the reverse KL divergence.\n\n\nviewof mean2 = slider({\n  min: meanRange[0],\n  max: meanRange[1],\n  step: meanStep,\n  value: -1.4, \n  title: \"Mean\", \n})\nviewof variance2 = slider({\n  min: varianceRange[0],\n  max: varianceRange[1],\n  step: varianceStep,\n  value: 1.5, \n  title: \"Variance\",\n})\n\nklGrid2 = calculateKLDivergenceGrid(\n    P,\n    d3.range(meanRange[0], meanRange[1] + meanStep, meanStep),\n    d3.range(varianceRange[0], varianceRange[1] + varianceStep, varianceStep),\n    false\n);\ngaussianPlot2 = createGuassianPlot(mean2, variance2, P);\nklContourPlot2 = createklContourPlot(\n    mean2, variance2, klGrid2,\n    `KL Divergence (&lt;tspan fill=\"steelblue\"&gt;Q&lt;/tspan&gt;, &lt;tspan fill=\"orange\"&gt;P&lt;/tspan&gt;) Contour Plot`\n);\n\n\nhtml`&lt;div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; column-gap: 1em;\"&gt;\n &lt;div style=\"flex-basis:50%\"&gt;${gaussianPlot2}&lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;div style=\"flex-basis:50%\"&gt;${klContourPlot2} &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see how the minimum is achieved when \\(Q\\) is concentrated around the dominant mode of \\(P\\). This is the mode-seeking/zero-forcing behavior of the reverse KL divergence [4], and makes it desirable in the context of density estimation and variational inference. My own intuition is that in these tasks we would rather find a tight, concentrated approximation and miss some modes, than spread out and place density in low-probability regions.\n\n\n\n4.4 Relations to Mutual Information\nLet \\((X,Y)\\) be a pair of random variables with values over the space \\({\\mathcal {X}}\\times {\\mathcal {Y}}\\). If their joint distribution is \\({P_{(X,Y)}}\\) and the marginal distributions are \\({P_{Y}}\\) and \\({P_{Y}}\\), the mutual information is defined as:\n\\[{I(X;Y)=D_{\\mathrm {KL} }(P_{(X,Y)}\\|P_{X}P_{Y})} \\tag{4}\\]\nNotice, as per property of the KL divergence that \\(I(X;Y)\\) is equal to zero precisely when the joint distribution coincides with the product of the marginals, i.e. when \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent (and hence observing \\(Y\\) tells you nothing about \\(X\\)). Intuitively, \\(I(X;Y)\\) is a measure of the price for encoding \\((X,Y)\\) as a pair of independent random variables when in reality they may not be.\nMutual information can also be expressed using conditional entropy:\n\\[{I(X;Y) \\equiv H(X) - H(X \\vert Y)}\\]\n Check out this video for a more detailed explanation: [5]"

    "text": "5 Jensen-Shannon Divergence\nJS divergence is a symmetric measure, derived from KL divergence, and it does satisfy the properties of a metric. It is defined as the average of the KL divergence from each distribution to the average of both distributions:\n\\[{JS(P \\;\\Vert\\; Q) = \\frac{1}{2}KL(P \\;\\Vert\\; M) + \\frac{1}{2}KL(Q \\;\\Vert\\; M)} \\tag{5}\\]\nwhere \\(M=\\dfrac{1}{2} (P+Q)\\) is a mixture of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\).\nThe averaging process and the introduction of \\(M\\) ensure that the divergence remains finite, even if one distribution assigns zero probability to an event that the other distribution assigns a positive probability.\nThis can be a desirable property in scenarios where you want a more stable and bounded measure of divergence. However, it also means that JS divergence is less sensitive to cases where one distribution completely ignores an event that the other considers possible."

Best to be selective about what we bring in."

We soon realized we needed a visualization tool to help us better understand the networks we were working with, and the motifs that were identified. This was when I stumbled on the D3.js library, and decided to use its force layout for interactive visualization. The tool below is based on the countless examples and tutrials I found, which I’ve lost track of, and should give a glimpse of the power of D3.js.\nThis example is a visualization of protein-protein interaction network. Its main features are:\nThe source code can be found here. The visualization code is in the output folder."

    "title": "Tractable large-scale deep reinforcement learning",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nReinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most promising and powerful techniques in deep learning. The training of intelligent agents requires a myriad of training examples which imposes a substantial computational cost. Consequently, RL is seldom applied to real-world problems and historically has been limited to computer vision tasks, similar to supervised learning. This work proposes an RL framework for complex, partially observable, large-scale environments. We introduce novel techniques for tractable training on commodity GPUs, and significantly reduce computational costs. Furthermore, we present a self-supervised loss that improves the learning stability in applications with a long-time horizon, shortening the training time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution on the application of road extraction from high-resolution satellite images. We present experiments on satellite images of fifteen cities that demonstrate comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time RL has been applied for extracting road networks. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/nsarang/road-extraction-rl."
