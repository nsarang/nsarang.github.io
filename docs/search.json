    "text": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most promising and powerful techniques in deep learning. The training of intelligent agents requires a myriad of training examples which imposes a substantial computational cost. Consequently, RL is seldom applied to real-world problems and historically has been limited to computer vision tasks, similar to supervised learning. This work proposes an RL framework for complex, partially observable, large-scale environments. We introduce novel techniques for tractable training on commodity GPUs, and significantly reduce computational costs. Furthermore, we present a self-supervised loss that improves the learning stability in applications with a long-time horizon, shortening the training time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution on the application of road extraction from high-resolution satellite images. We present experiments on satellite images of fifteen cities that demonstrate comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time RL has been applied for extracting road networks. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/nsarang/road-extraction-rl."

    "text": "About Me\nPrior to working at Expedia Group, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at Divar, where I worked on pricing and computer vision models for the largest e-commerce platform in Iran. I had the joy and fortune of working with a lot of talented people, and learned how to build and deploy machine learning models at scale.\nI completed my masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Concordia University, where I was a member of the Immersive & Creative Technologies Lab. I worked on applying deep reinforement learning to satellite imagery data for extracting road networks using controllable agents.\nIâ€™m a passionate about solving problems. In my free time, I often participate in Kaggle-like competitions to learn about applying ML techniques to different problems. I try to keep up with the latest research in the field, and am always looking for ways to improve my skills. One of the reason I started this website is to write about things I discover and share cool stuff.\n\nLetâ€™s do something awesome together!\nIf youâ€™re interested in working with me, please drop me a line at contact@nimasarang.com!"

    "text": "According to structure-dependent function of proteins, two main challenging problems called Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) and Inverse Protein Folding (IPF) are investigated. In spite of IPF essential applications, it has not been studied as much as PSP problem. In fact, the ultimate goal of IPF problem or protein design is to create proteins with enhanced properties or even novel functions. One of the major computational challenges in protein design is large protein sequence space, namely searching through all plausible sequences is impossible. In our previous research, we introduced a genetic algorithm called GAPSSIF for designing protein secondary structure. This algorithm benefits from evolutionary information obtained by solved protein structures in PDB. Therefore, we constructed a repository of protein secondary sub-structures to accelerate convergence of the algorithm. The secondary structures of designed sequences by GAPSSIF are comparable with those obtained by Evolver and EvoDesign. In this paper, we modify GAPSSIF so it considers solvent accessibility. Therefore, the simple fitness function of GAPSSIF is improved by a multi-featured one to search through the sequence space more precisely."
