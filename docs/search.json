We introduce novel techniques for tractable training on commodity GPUs, and significantly reduce computational costs. Furthermore, we present a self-supervised loss that improves the learning stability in applications with a long-time horizon, shortening the training time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution on the application of road extraction from high-resolution satellite images. We present experiments on satellite images of fifteen cities that demonstrate comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.

    "section": "Multi-Layer LSTM",
    "text": "Multi-Layer LSTM\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture specifically designed to handle long-term dependencies in sequential data. It incorporates a memory state, a hidden state, and three gating mechanisms: the input gate, forget gate, and output gate. These gates control the flow of information into, out of, and within the memory and hidden states, allowing the LSTM to selectively remember or forget information at each time step.\nThe memory state in an LSTM acts as a long-term storage unit, allowing the network to retain information over long sequences. The input gate determines how much new information should be stored in the memory state, while the forget gate controls the amount of old information to be discarded. The output gate regulates the flow of information from the memory state and hidden state to the next time step.\n\n\n\nLSTM Architecture [1]\n\n\nThe LSTM cell consists of the following components: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_t &= \\sigma(W_{if}x_t + b_{if} + W_{hf}h_{t-1} + b_{hf}) \\\\\ni_t &= \\sigma(W_{ii}x_t + b_{ii} + W_{hi}h_{t-1} + b_{hi}) \\\\\no_t &= \\sigma(W_{io}x_t + b_{io} + W_{ho}h_{t-1} + b_{ho}) \\\\\n\\tilde{C}_t &= \\tanh(W_{ic}x_t + b_{ic} + W_{hc}h_{t-1} + b_{hc}) \\\\\nC_t &= f_t \\odot C_{t-1} + i_t \\odot \\tilde{C}_t \\\\\nh_t &= o_t \\odot \\tanh(C_t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(f_t\\), \\(i_t\\), and \\(o_t\\) are the forget, input, and output gates, respectively. \\(\\tilde{C}_t\\) is the candidate memory state, \\(C_t\\) is the memory state, and \\(h_t\\) is the hidden state at time step \\(t\\). \\(x_t\\) is the input at time step \\(t\\), \\(h_{t-1}\\) is the hidden state at time step \\(t-1\\), and \\(W\\) and \\(b\\) are the weights and biases of each gate.\nA multi-latyer LSTM is simply stacking multiple LSTM cells on top of each other. The output of the previous LSTM cell is fed as input to the next LSTM cell. The hidden state of the last LSTM cell is the input to the classification layer.\n\n\n\nMulti-layer LSTM Example [2]. Each row of the green rectangles represent an LSTM cell.\n\n\nNow let’s get into the implementation, step by step.\n\n&gt; lstm.py\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                Import the dependencies.  \nThe activation functions are defined in a separate module\n\n            \n            \n                1import numpy as np\n2from collections import defaultdict\n3from copy import deepcopy\n4from op import sigmoid, tanh, softmax\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                LSTM Classifier\nMulti-layer LSTM classifier for sequence classification tasks.\nIt consists of an embedding layer, multiple LSTM cells, and a classification head.\nThe model is used to process input sequences and generate output logits.\n\n            \n            \n                5class LSTMClassifier:\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                \n            \n            \n                 6    def __init__(\n 7        self,\n 8        embed_size,\n 9        hidden_size,\n10        vocab_size,\n11        n_cells=1,\n12        dropout=0,\n13    ) -&gt; None:\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                Define internal variables\n\n            \n            \n                14        self.embed_size = embed_size\n15        self.hidden_size = hidden_size\n16        self.vocab_size = vocab_size\n17        self.n_cells = n_cells\n18        self.layers = dict()\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                Embedding layer\n\n            \n            \n                19        self.layers[\"embedding\"] = np.empty((vocab_size, embed_size))\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                Create LSTM layers\n\n            \n            \n                20        for cell_index in range(n_cells):\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                forget, output, and cell gates\n\n            \n            \n                21            for layer_name in [\"f\", \"o\", \"c\"]:\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    #\n                \n                The input size of the first layer is embed_size + hidden_size, since the input is the concatenation of the input features and the previous hidden state.

Adam optimizer uses both the first and second moments of the gradients to adapt the learning rate tailored to each parameter.

We’ll use the Shakespeare dataset, which consists of a collection of Shakespeare’s plays. The model will be trained to predict the next character in the sequence given a sequence of characters.\nAn important distinction to make between the text generation at training time and inference time is that at training time, we feed the ground truth characters to the model to predict the next character; This is called teacher forcing. At inference time, we feed the model’s prediction at time step \\(t\\) as the input at time step \\(t+1\\) to predict the next character.\n\nLoad\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\n\nDownload the Shakespeare dataset which is a single text file from the following link: Shakespeare dataset\n\nwith open(\"shakespeare.txt\") as file:\n    data = file.read()\n\n\nprint(data[:200])\n\nFirst Citizen:\nBefore we proceed any further, hear me speak.\n\nAll:\nSpeak, speak.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nYou are all resolved rather to die than to famish?\n\nAll:\nResolved. resolved.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nFirst, you\n\n\n\n\nPreprocess\nWe need to convert the text data into numerical data.

The code is based on the Francois Chollet’s Deep Learning with Python, page 308.\nDCGAN is an extension of the GAN architecture, where the generator and discriminator are deep convolutional networks. The discriminator that takes an image as input and outputs a single scalar value representing the probability that the input image is real (as opposed to fake). The generator takes a random vector as input and decodes it into a synthetic image, and is trained to generate images that the discriminator identifies as real.\nThe code is available on my GitHub.\n\nWhat worked\n\nUsing dropout in the discriminator\n\nAdding noise to the labels\n\nUsing strided convolutions\n\nNormalizing the data to \\([-1, 1]\\)\nRMSprop optimizer\n\n\n\nWhat didn’t work\n\nUsing high learning rates (&gt;1e-3)\nI initially normalized the data between 0 and 1, but since I was using “tanh” as the last layer of the generator’s output, it made the convergence a lot harder\nConstructing separate batches for real and fake images\nTraining the discriminator with more steps than the generator\nUsing SGD optimizer\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is the first 5000 iterations of the training history. The random vectors are fixed at the beginning of the training. As the training progresses, the generator learns to generate more realistic images."

    "text": "While working as a research assistant at the Computational Biology Research Center at the Amirkabir University of Technology, I was tasked with implmenting an algorithm for Identification of large disjoint motifs in biological networks. We soon realized we needed a visualization tool to help us better understand the networks we were working with, and the motifs that were identified. This was when I stumbled on the D3.js library, and decided to use its force layout for interactive visualization. The tool below is based on the countless examples and tutrials I found, which I’ve lost track of, and should give a glimpse of the power of D3.js.\nThis example is a visualization of protein-protein interaction network. Its main features are:\nThe source code can be found here. The visualization code is in the output folder."
